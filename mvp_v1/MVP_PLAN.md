# MVP Plan: Twitter Pattern Analysis Service

## 1. Project Vision
To provide a data-driven service that helps Twitter users move beyond guesswork and create high-engagement content by analyzing successful patterns in their specific niche.

## 2. Target Audience
- Content Creators
- Marketers
- Founders & Indie Hackers
- Personal Brands looking to grow their authority

## 3. Problem Statement
Users struggle to create consistently high-performing content on Twitter. They often rely on intuition or copy what seems to work for large accounts, without a systematic, data-driven understanding of the specific patterns (hooks, formats, conversation triggers) that resonate with audiences in *their* niche.

## 4. The MVP Concept ("Wizard of Oz" Approach)
This MVP will test the core value proposition with a concierge-style, manual backend. The goal is to validate user demand for the analysis and the resulting content *before* investing heavily in automation.

**Core Workflow:**
1.  **User Submits:** Users provide 5-10 Twitter profile URLs from their niche for analysis.
2.  **Manual Backend:** The founder (you) receives the submission and manually runs the analysis using the existing Claude-based system.
3.  **Founder Delivers Analysis:** You upload the pattern analysis documents to the user's dashboard.
4.  **User Submits Content Ideas:** Impressed by the analysis, the user submits their raw content ideas or a "content dump."
5.  **Founder Creates Tweets:** You manually use the patterns to transform the user's ideas into ready-to-post tweets and upload them.
6.  **User Provides Feedback:** The user can request iterations on the generated tweets.

## 5. Key Hypotheses to Test
The MVP is designed to answer these critical questions:
-   **Value Hypothesis:** Do users find the niche-specific pattern analysis valuable enough to complete the submission process?
-   **Actionability Hypothesis:** Is the connection between the "analysis" and the "generated tweets" clear and compelling to the user?
-   **Adoption Hypothesis:** Will users see enough value in the generated tweets to consider using them?
-   **Willingness-to-Pay Hypothesis:** Is the overall service valuable enough that users would consider paying for it in the future?

## 6. Success Metrics for the MVP
-   **Sign-up Rate:** Number of users who complete onboarding.
-   **Submission Completion Rate:** Percentage of users who submit profiles for analysis.
-   **Content Submission Rate:** Percentage of users who, after seeing the analysis, submit their own content ideas for tweet generation.
-   **Qualitative Feedback:** Direct user feedback on the quality of the analysis and the generated tweets (via the iteration feature).
-   **Retention:** Number of users who return to submit more content ideas.
