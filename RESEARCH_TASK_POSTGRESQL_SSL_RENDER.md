# Research Task: PostgreSQL SSL Connection Error on Render with Python 3.13

## Problem Statement
FastAPI application deployed on Render is failing to connect to Render PostgreSQL database with error:
```
sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: (psycopg2.OperationalError) connection to server at "dpg-d3ol5dali9vc738ne3c0-a.oregon-postgres.render.com" (35.227.164.209), port 5432 failed: SSL connection has been closed unexpectedly
```

## Current Setup
- **Python Version**: 3.13 (latest)
- **Database Driver**: psycopg2-binary 2.9.10
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy 2.0.36
- **Platform**: Render.com
- **Database**: Render PostgreSQL (managed)

## What We've Already Tried

### 1. Added SSL mode to connection string
```python
if database_url.startswith("postgresql") and "sslmode" not in database_url:
    separator = "&" if "?" in database_url else "?"
    database_url = f"{database_url}{separator}sslmode=require"
```

### 2. Added SSL mode to connect_args
```python
connect_args = {
    "connect_timeout": 10,
    "sslmode": "require"
}
```

### 3. Configured connection pool
```python
engine = create_engine(
    database_url,
    connect_args=connect_args,
    pool_pre_ping=True,
    pool_recycle=300,
    pool_size=5,
    max_overflow=10
)
```

### 4. Verified Render documentation
According to https://render.com/docs/troubleshooting-deploys:
- They recommend "setting sslmode=require and/or setting up a connection pool"
- We've done BOTH and error persists

## Research Questions

### Primary Question
**What is the definitive fix for `SSL connection has been closed unexpectedly` error when connecting to Render PostgreSQL from a Python 3.13 application using psycopg2-binary 2.9.10?**

### Specific Sub-Questions

1. **Is psycopg2-binary 2.9.10 fully compatible with Python 3.13 for SSL connections?**
   - Are there known SSL/TLS issues with psycopg2-binary on Python 3.13?
   - Should we use source-compiled psycopg2 instead of psycopg2-binary?

2. **Should we migrate to psycopg (version 3)?**
   - Is psycopg3 better supported on Python 3.13?
   - What are the migration steps from psycopg2 to psycopg3 with SQLAlchemy?
   - Are there breaking changes in connection string format?

3. **Render-specific PostgreSQL connection requirements**
   - Does Render PostgreSQL require specific SSL parameters beyond `sslmode=require`?
   - Should we use the "Internal Database URL" instead of the external one?
   - Does Render provide SSL certificates that need to be referenced?

4. **SQLAlchemy connection configuration**
   - Is there a better way to pass SSL parameters through SQLAlchemy to psycopg2?
   - Should we use `connect_args` differently?
   - Are there SQLAlchemy 2.0.36-specific SSL connection patterns?

5. **Alternative solutions**
   - Can we use connection pooling at the application level (e.g., pgbouncer)?
   - Should we disable SSL verification temporarily to test if that's the issue?
   - Are there environment variables we should set?

## Expected Deliverables

1. **Root cause identification**: Explain WHY the SSL connection is being closed unexpectedly
2. **Definitive fix**: Provide working code that resolves the issue
3. **Best practices**: Recommend the best approach for Python 3.13 + Render PostgreSQL
4. **Migration path**: If switching to psycopg3, provide migration steps
